# DoSU

## About DoSu

**DoSU** is a handy note-taking tool which saves you a lot of energy when you take notes in a vim-like environment. It can automatically create filesystem for your new subject, automatically create new notes and compile notes from n months.

Current development status of DoSU is closed due to not having enough time and resources to enchance the power f DoSU, but I'm sure that someday I will :)

## What does DoSu stand for ?

> DoSU = Do Something Useful :)

## How can I install DoSU ?

On a unix-like system you just need to download dosu source file and extract it in a proper folder (depends on your filesystem) and then add it to the global **$PATH** variable
